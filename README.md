## Description

A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years.

## Specifications

| Specification | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds | 27 (years) | 851472000 (seconds)
| Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.  Application will compare input date against the current time to come up with an accurate age in seconds. | 4/19/2018 - 4/20/2018 | 86400 (seconds)
| Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.) | 27 | 112
| Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.) | 27 | 43
| Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.) | 27 | 14
| Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.) | 27 | 2
| Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet. Use average life expectancy of world which is 68 years  | 70 years | Lived 2 years passed expectancy
| If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy. | 70 years | You have lived 2 years past your life expency on this planet"
