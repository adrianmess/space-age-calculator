## Description

A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years.

## Specifications

| Specification | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds | 27 (years) | 851472000 (seconds)
| Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.  Application will compare input date against the current time to come up with an accurate age in seconds. | 01/01/1986 - 01/01/1987 | 31,556,952 (seconds)
| Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.) | 27 | 112.5
| Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.) | 27 | 43.5
| Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.) | 27 | 14.4
| Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.) | 27 | 2.3
| Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet  | * | *
| If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy. | * | *
